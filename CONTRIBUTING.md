5. Make your changes
6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## üíª Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend development without Docker)
- Python 3.11+ (for backend development without Docker)
- Git

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Helix.git
cd Helix

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/divagr18/Helix.git

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values

# Start services
docker-compose up -d
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome many types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes**
- **New features**
- **Documentation improvements**
- **Code refactoring**
- **Tests**
- **UI/UX improvements**
- **Performance optimizations**
- **Security enhancements**

### Finding Something to Work On

1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/divagr18/Helix/issues) page
2. Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
3. Comment on an issue to let others know you're working on it
4. Ask questions if you need clarification

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

- Follow **PEP 8** style guide
- Use **type hints** where appropriate
- Write **docstrings** for functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use **meaningful variable names**

```python
def calculate_complexity(code: str) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the cyclomatic complexity of given code.
    
    Args:
        code: Source code string to analyze
        
    Returns:
        Integer representing cyclomatic complexity
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

**Linting:**
```bash
cd backend
ruff check .
ruff format .
```

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)

- Follow **TypeScript** best practices
- Use **functional components** and hooks
- Keep components **small and reusable**
- Use **meaningful prop names**
- Write **JSDoc comments** for complex functions

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
    onClick: () => void;
    disabled?: boolean;
    children: React.ReactNode;
}

/**
 * Primary button component with consistent styling
 */
export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ onClick, disabled, children }) => {
    // Implementation
};
```

**Linting:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### General Guidelines

- Write **clear commit messages**
- Add **tests** for new features
- Update **documentation** when needed
- Keep **PRs focused** on a single change
- **Rebase** instead of merge when updating your branch
