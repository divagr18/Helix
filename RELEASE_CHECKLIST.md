## ‚úÖ READY FOR OPEN SOURCE RELEASE

All critical items are complete. The minor TODOs are for future enhancements and don't block the initial release.

**Recommended next steps:**
1. Double-check no `.env` file is committed
2. Test fresh installation on a clean machine
3. Create v1.0.0 release tag
4. Publish to GitHub
5. Share on relevant communities (Reddit, Hacker News, etc.)
